	"ext_explanation": "This bot allows you to let the members of the server report unruly behaviors and take immediate action against it. This is great if you have a small moderation team or you'd like to ease their burden. Since all server are different it is important to tailor the thresholds of each rule for your server. There are 2 community moderation commands: `spam` and `abuse`. The first is a command that, when used by enough people on the same member, mutes the said member. The later allows members to report behaviors they consider unruly and that might have slipped the attention of the moderators.",
